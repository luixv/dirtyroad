Zeno Font Resizer allows the visitors of your website to change the font size of your text.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to give the visitors of your site the option to change the font size of your text.

Features:

* Uses JavaScript and jQuery to set the fontsize.
* Settings are saved in a cookie, so the visitor sees the same fontsize on a revisit.
* Admin page to set which content is being resized, the resize steps and other options.
* You can use the standard widget or you can use code to add to your theme.
* Simple and Lightweight.

This plugin is a fork of font-resizer with many bugfixes applied and features added.

= Compatibility =

This plugin is compatible with [ClassicPress](https://www.classicpress.net).


== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `zeno-font-resizer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin directly with the 'Install' function in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Add the sidebar widget through the 'Appearance / Widgets' menu in WordPress.
4. If you don't want to use the widget, you can use the template code somewhere in your template. Please check the FAQ.
5. Define which content should be resized on the 'Zeno Font Resizer' admin page (optional). If you are not familiar with html and css, select the html option (default). This would resize all the content of your site.

== Screenshots ==

1. A productive example of the widget.
2. Adding the widget.
3. Settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I activate the function of the plugin? =
Go to the admin page of the plugin and select your option. If you are not familiar with html and css, select the html option (default). This would resize all the content of your site.

= I click the resizer, but (some of) my fonts don't change in size. =

The plugin expects the CSS of your theme to be set up in a flexible way. When you have a static font-size like 14px or 14pt for your menu or content elements, this will not be affected by the plugin. This way of using font-size is maybe pixel-perfect for the designer, but not accessible for the user, so you should only use it for design elements, like a text overlay for an image.

When you use a percentage, like 100% or 124%, it is dynamic and will follow (inherit) the font-size of the parent (and so up).
The same dynamic counts for setting in em.

= I use font-size in rem in my theme, what do I do? =

The font-size in rem is relative to the font-size of the root <html> element. So you can go to the Settingspage of this plugin,
and set the html element as the element to change the font-size of (default since 1.4.4). Now your rem elements should follow the resizing.

= How can I use the plugin without the widget? =
Use this snippet of PHP code (in your theme or somewhere):

	<?php
		if (function_exists('zeno_font_resizer_place')) {
			zeno_font_resizer_place();
		}
	?>

= How can I use the template code and do stuff with it? =
You can use the parameter '$echo = false' and the function will return the html-string:

	<?php
		if (function_exists('zeno_font_resizer_place')) {
			$font_resizer = zeno_font_resizer_place( false );
			// do stuff with $font_resizer...
		}
	?>

= How can I change the color of the A's? =
With CSS in your theme.
Use something like:

	p.zeno_font_resizer > a {
		color: blue;
	}

= On the widget I see text meant for screen-readers. =

Your theme is missing some necessary CSS for '.screen-reader-text'. Please contact the maker of your theme.
More information can be found in the [Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/markup/the-css-class-screen-reader-text/) about Accessibility.

= I want to use a shortcode in my content element =

There is an additional plugin on [Github](https://github.com/MPolleke/zeno-font-resizer-shortcode) you can use for that.
