Verify your BuddyPress members and display a twitter-like verified badge on the front-end.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to verify your BuddyPress members individually or based on WP roles. You can also allow members to request verification directly from their member profile.

Verified members will have a twitter-like "verified" badge displayed on the front-end, and you can choose to display an "unverified" badge for those who haven't been verified yet.

A dedicated settings tab allows you to choose where you want to display the badges:
+ Activities
+ Profiles
+ Member Lists (e.g.: member directory)
+ BuddyPress widgets
+ Private Messages
+ bbPress Forums
+ WordPress Comments and Posts

As well as other settings like the badge color or tooltip.

This plugin is also compatible with [BP Better Message](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-better-messages/)

See the plugin in action in our online demo:

+ [Members Directory](https://classic.gwangi-theme.com/members/).
+ [User Profile and Activity Feed](https://classic.gwangi-theme.com/members/michellie/).

This plugin requires [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/).
